# random-article-generator
The intention behind this project is to create something interesting to allow me to dive into Python 3 while building experience using GitHub.
random-article-generator takes an existing word list and, based on user inputs, randomly selects words from the list and appends them to an output file. 
Some formatting tasks will be added over time, such as selective and random capitalization, punctuation.
The goal is to eventually move away from random word selection and develop an understanding of how to work with probability in Python 3 to allow for more intelligent/sensible sentences to be created.
The impetus for this project was an early Python 3 tutorial I was working on that required me to create a text file with random text that was pretty long. I didn't feel like typing and copy/pasting, so I decided instead to spend weeks on end working on this project. Seems like a reasonable thought.
